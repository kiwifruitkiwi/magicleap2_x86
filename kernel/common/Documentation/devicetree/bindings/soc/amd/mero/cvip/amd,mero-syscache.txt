* AMD CVIP system cache

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "amd,mero-syscache"
- reg: Base address and size of the CVIP control/status registers
       and PL310 controllers registers
- interrupt-parent: Parent of PL310 controller interrupt
- interrupts: Interrupts of DECERR, SLVERR, ERRRD, ERRRT, ERRWD,
              ERRWT, PARRD, PARRT, ECNTR from PL310 controllers

Optional properties:
- arm,tag-latency: Cycles of latency for Tag RAM accesses. Specifies 3 cells of
      read, write and setup latencies. Controllers without setup latency control
      should use 0. Controllers without separate read and write Tag RAM latency
      values should only use the first cell. Should contain 3 entries:
  - setup tag latency
  - read tag latency
  - write tag latency

- arm,data-latency: Cycles of latency for Data RAM accesses. Specifies 3 cells of
      read, write and setup latencies. Minimum valid values are 1. Controllers
      without setup latency control should use a value of 0. Should contain 3 entries:
  - setup data latency
  - read data latency
  - write data latency

- arm,filter-ranges: Starting address and length of window to filter.
      Addresses in the filter window are directed to the M1 port. Other
      addresses will go to the M0 port. Should contain 2 entries:
  - filtering start address
  - filtering range

- arm,event-monitor: When present, enable event monitor bus
- arm,ns-int-ctrl: When present, enable non-secure interrupt access control
- arm,shared-override: When present, shared attribute internally ignored
- arm,parity-enable: When present, enable parity checking
- arm,parity-disable: When present, disable parity checking
- arm,double-linefill: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable double linefill
- arm,double-linefill-incr: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable incr double linefill
- arm,double-linefill-wrap: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable double linefill on WRAP read
- arm,prefetch-drop: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable prefetch drop
- arm,prefetch-offset: Must be values of 0-7, 15, 23, and 31
- prefetch-data: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable data prefetching
- prefetch-instr: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable instruction prefetching
- arm,dynamic-clock-gating: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable dynamic clock gating
- arm,standby-mode: Must be 1 or 0, enable/disable standby mode
- cache-size: Should not be greater than 512K
- cache-sets: Num of cache sets
- cache-line-size: Size of cache line. If not present, it's equal to blocksize.
- cache-block-size: Size of cache block.
