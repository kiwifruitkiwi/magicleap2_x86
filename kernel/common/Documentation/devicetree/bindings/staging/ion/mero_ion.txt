AMD ION for Mero CVIP

ION is a memory manager that allows for sharing of buffers between different
processes and between user space and kernel space. ION manages different
memory spaces by separating the memory spaces into "heaps".

Required properties:
- compatible: "amd,mero-ion"

Required properties for ION heaps
- reg: the ID of the ION heap.
- memory-region: physical memory region for the heap, can reference to
	memory region nodes defined in reserved-memory section.
- mero,ion-heap-type: the heap type to use for this heap, should be one of
  the following:
	- "SYSTEM"
	- "SYSTEM_CONTIG"
	- "CARVEOUT"
	- "CHUNK"
	- "DMA"

- mero,ion-heap-init-type: option for clearing the memory region to zero when
	heap is created, default is to clear memory to zero, should be one of
	the following:
	- "memory-clear"
	- "memory-no-clear"

Example:
	mero,ion {
		compatible = "amd,mero-ion";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		mero,ion-heap@10 {
			reg = <10>;
			memory-region = <&sram_q6_s0>;
			mero,ion-heap-type = "CARVEOUT";
			mero,ion-heap-init-type = "memory-no-clear";
		};
	};

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		sram_q6_s0: q6_s0@c4000000 {
			reg = <0x0 0xc4000000 0x0 0x000c0000>;
		};
	}
