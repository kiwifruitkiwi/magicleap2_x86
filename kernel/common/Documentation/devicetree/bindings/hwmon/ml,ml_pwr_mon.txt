Magic Leap Power Monitor driver

The power monitor driver registers INA devices from the EC
as hwmon devices and receives updates for current, voltage,
and power for the channels.

Required properties:
- compatible: "ml,ml_pwr_mon"

Example:
pwr_mon {
	compatible = "ml,ml_pwr_mon";
	mlmux = <&mux>;
};
