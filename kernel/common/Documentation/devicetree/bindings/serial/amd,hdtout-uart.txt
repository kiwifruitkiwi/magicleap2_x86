* AMD HDTOUT UART

The AMD's HDTOUT UART is used for interfacing SoC with serial
communication devices in an emulation environment. No flow control
and clock control in this emulation UART.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "amd,hdtout-1.0"

- reg: base physical address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

Example:
	hdtout_uart0: serial@800000 {
		status = "ok";
		compatible = "amd,hdtout-1.0";
		reg = <0x0 0x800000 0x0 0x1000>;
	};
