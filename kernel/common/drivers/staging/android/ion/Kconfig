menuconfig ION
	bool "Ion Memory Manager"
	depends on HAS_DMA && MMU
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the ION Memory Manager,
	  used by Android to efficiently allocate buffers
	  from userspace that can be shared between drivers.
	  If you're not using Android its probably safe to
	  say N here.

config ION_SYSTEM_HEAP
	bool "Ion system heap"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the Ion system heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config ION_CARVEOUT_HEAP
	bool "Ion carveout heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable carveout heaps with Ion. Carveout heaps
	  are backed by memory reserved from the system. Allocation times are
	  typically faster at the cost of memory not being used. Unless you
	  know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CHUNK_HEAP
	bool "Ion chunk heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable chunk heaps with Ion. This heap is
	  similar in function the carveout heap but memory is broken down
	  into smaller chunk sizes, typically corresponding to a TLB size.
	  Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CMA_HEAP
	bool "Ion CMA heap support"
	depends on ION && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable CMA heaps with Ion. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config ION_MERO
	bool "Ion MERO CVIP heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option if you wish to use ion on an MERO CVIP target.
	  Features include allocating heaps from device tree, buffer
	  cache maintenance, and a custom ioctl/compat_ioctl. Enable
	  utility functions used by ion_system_heap.

config ION_CARVEOUT_HEAP_PAGE_ZERO
	bool "Ion carveout heap to zero page upon creation"
	depends on ION && ION_CARVEOUT_HEAP
	help
	  Choose this option to enable carveout heap regions to be initialized
	  with zero upon creation. On target such as MERO CVIP A55, when
	  carveout heaps for DSP internal SRAM are created at boot time, page
	  zeroing can cause A55 hang due to SRAM is not accessible at early
	  stage, in which case should say N. Unless you know your system has
	  these regions accessible at creation time, you should say N here.

config ION_TEST
	tristate "Ion Test Device"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to create a device that can be used to test the
	  kernel and device side ION functions.
